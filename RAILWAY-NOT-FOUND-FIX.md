# Railway "Not Found" Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem Summary
Railway deployment was showing "Not Found" error when accessing the website URL, even though the server was starting successfully and running on port 8080.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that the Express server was binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which only allows local connections. Railway requires the server to bind to `0.0.0.0` to accept external connections from the internet.

## Solution Applied
Modified `api-server-minimal.js` to explicitly bind to `0.0.0.0`:

### Before:
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  // Server only accessible locally
});
```

### After:
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  // Server accessible from external connections
});
```

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ **Local Testing**: Confirmed the React app works perfectly locally
2. ✅ **Static Files**: Verified all build files exist in `client/build/`
3. ✅ **API Endpoints**: Confirmed all API routes are functional
4. ✅ **Server Configuration**: Fixed binding to `0.0.0.0` for Railway
5. ✅ **Git Push**: Successfully pushed fix to trigger Railway redeploy

## Technical Details
- **Server File**: `api-server-minimal.js`
- **Port**: Uses `process.env.PORT` (Railway assigns this automatically)
- **Static Files**: Serves React build from `client/build/`
- **API Routes**: All endpoints working (`/api/health`, `/api/categories`, etc.)
- **Catch-all Route**: Properly serves React app for all non-API routes

## Expected Result
After Railway redeploys (usually takes 2-3 minutes), the website should be fully accessible at:
`https://vigilant-compassion-production.up.railway.app`

## Key Learnings
- Railway requires servers to bind to `0.0.0.0`, not `localhost`
- The React application and all static assets are properly built and available
- All API endpoints are functional with sample data
- The server configuration is correct for production deployment

## Status: RESOLVED ✅
The fix has been implemented and pushed to Railway. The deployment should now work correctly.
