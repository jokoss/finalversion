# Railway 404 Not Found Fix Solution

## Problem

The React app was not being served correctly on Railway. When hitting the root URL (`/`), the API server was returning a 404 error instead of serving the React app.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented Option 1 from the suggested solutions: **Serve the CRA build from the existing Express server**.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated package.json**:
   - Changed the start script from `node server/index.js` to `node api-server-minimal.js`
   - This uses the minimal API server which already has the correct configuration to serve the React app

2. **Updated nixpacks.toml**:
   - Changed the start command from `node server/index.js` to `node api-server-minimal.js`
   - This ensures Railway uses the correct server file during deployment

3. **No changes needed to api-server-minimal.js**:
   - The file already contained the necessary code to:
     - Serve static files from the client/build directory
     - Send the React index.html for any non-API routes

### Key Code in api-server-minimal.js:

```javascript
// — 2) Serve React's build as static files
const clientBuildPath = path.join(__dirname, 'client', 'build');
app.use(express.static(clientBuildPath));

// API routes defined here...

// — 3) For any other GET, send back React's index.html
app.get('*', (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(clientBuildPath, 'index.html'));
});
```

## How This Fixes the Issue

1. The Express server now serves the React app's static files from the `client/build` directory
2. Any API requests (e.g., `/api/categories`) are handled by the API routes
3. Any other GET requests that don't match API routes will serve the React app's index.html
4. This enables client-side routing to work correctly, as all non-API routes return the React app

## Deployment

To deploy this fix:

1. Commit the changes to your repository
2. Push to your Railway-connected repository or redeploy manually
3. Railway will build and deploy the application using the updated configuration

After deployment, visiting the root URL will now serve the React app instead of returning a 404 error.
