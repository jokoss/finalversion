# Railway Deployment Guide for Analytical Testing Laboratory

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your Analytical Testing Laboratory application to Railway, a modern cloud platform that makes deploying Docker applications simple.

## Why Railway?

Railway offers several advantages for deploying your application:

- **Free tier** available for testing and small projects
- **Automatic Docker deployment** with GitHub integration
- **Built-in PostgreSQL** database service
- **Custom domains** with SSL certificates
- **Automatic CI/CD** from your GitHub repository
- **Simple environment variable** management
- **Horizontal scaling** capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
2. Your application code pushed to a GitHub repository
3. A [Railway](https://railway.app) account (you can sign up with GitHub)

## Step 1: Sign Up for Railway

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Login" in the top right corner
3. Select "Login with GitHub"
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account

## Step 2: Create a New Project

1. From the Railway dashboard, click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your repository from the list
4. Railway will automatically detect your Dockerfile and use it for deployment

## Step 3: Add a PostgreSQL Database

1. In your project dashboard, click "New"
2. Select "Database"
3. Choose "PostgreSQL"
4. Railway will provision a new PostgreSQL database
5. Once created, click on the database service to view connection details

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Click on your web service (the one created from your GitHub repo)
2. Go to the "Variables" tab
3. Add the following environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=<Your Railway PostgreSQL connection string>
JWT_SECRET=<Generate a secure random string>
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<Secure admin password>
```

> **Note**: Railway automatically provides the `DATABASE_URL` variable to your application, but you may need to reference it explicitly in your service's variables.

## Step 5: Configure Build Settings (Optional)

1. Go to the "Settings" tab of your web service
2. Under "Build Settings", you can customize:
   - Root directory (if your app is in a subdirectory)
   - Build command (if needed)
   - Start command (if different from Dockerfile CMD)

## Step 6: Deploy Your Application

1. Railway automatically deploys your application when you push to your GitHub repository
2. You can also manually trigger a deployment by clicking "Deploy" in the top right corner
3. Watch the deployment logs to ensure everything is working correctly

## Step 7: Set Up a Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to the "Settings" tab of your web service
2. Under "Domains", click "Generate Domain" for a railway.app subdomain
3. Or click "Custom Domain" to use your own domain
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions provided by Railway

## Step 8: Monitor Your Application

1. Go to the "Metrics" tab to view resource usage
2. Check the "Logs" tab for application logs
3. Set up notifications in "Settings" for deployment and error alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If your application can't connect to the database:

1. Verify the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correctly set
2. Check that your application is using the correct connection string format
3. Ensure your database service is running (check the status in Railway dashboard)

### Build Failures

If your Docker build fails:

1. Check the build logs for specific errors
2. Verify your Dockerfile is correctly configured
3. Ensure all required files are included in your repository
4. Check that your `.dockerignore` file isn't excluding necessary files

### Application Crashes

If your application crashes after deployment:

1. Check the application logs in the "Logs" tab
2. Verify all required environment variables are set
3. Ensure your application handles database migrations correctly
4. Check for memory or resource limitations

## Scaling Your Application

Railway makes it easy to scale your application:

1. Go to the "Settings" tab of your web service
2. Under "Resources", adjust the memory and CPU allocation
3. For horizontal scaling, contact Railway support to enable multiple instances

## Continuous Deployment

Railway automatically sets up continuous deployment from your GitHub repository:

1. Every push to your main branch triggers a new deployment
2. You can configure branch deployments in the "Settings" tab
3. Preview deployments are created for pull requests

## Cost Management

Railway offers a free tier, but for production applications:

1. Monitor your usage in the "Billing" section
2. Set up spending limits to avoid unexpected charges
3. Consider upgrading to a paid plan for more resources and features

## Security Best Practices

1. Never commit sensitive environment variables to your repository
2. Use Railway's variable management for secrets
3. Regularly update your application dependencies
4. Enable Railway's automatic HTTPS for all domains
5. Implement proper authentication and authorization in your application

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

1. Railway automatically backs up your PostgreSQL database
2. You can manually export your database from the database service dashboard
3. Consider implementing application-level backups for critical data

## Next Steps

1. Set up monitoring and alerting
2. Implement a CI/CD pipeline with tests
3. Configure automatic database migrations
4. Set up staging and production environments
