# Railway Dashboard Fix Guide

This guide documents the changes made to fix the dashboard data loading issue in the Railway deployment.

## Problem

After deploying the application to Railway, the admin dashboard was not loading data from the database. The dashboard was showing hardcoded mock data instead of actual data from the database.

## Solution

We implemented the following changes to fix the issue:

1. Created a new dashboard controller (`server/controllers/dashboard.controller.js`) that fetches real data from the database:
   - Retrieves category count
   - Retrieves test count
   - Fetches recent tests with their associated categories

2. Added a new admin route for the dashboard (`server/routes/dashboard.admin.routes.js`) to expose the dashboard data API endpoint.

3. Updated the admin routes configuration (`server/routes/admin.routes.js`) to include the new dashboard routes.

4. Modified the AdminDashboard component (`client/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.js`) to fetch data from the API instead of using hardcoded mock data.

5. Updated the API utility (`client/src/utils/api.js`) to properly detect Railway deployments and set the correct API base URL.

## Deployment

To deploy these changes to Railway, run one of the following scripts:

- On Linux/Mac: `./deploy-dashboard-fix.sh`
- On Windows: `deploy-dashboard-fix.bat`

These scripts will:
1. Add the modified files to git
2. Commit the changes with an appropriate message
3. Deploy the changes to Railway using the Railway CLI

## Verification

After deployment, you can verify the fix by:

1. Logging into the admin dashboard at: https://vigilant-compassion-production.up.railway.app/login
2. Checking that the dashboard shows actual data from the database:
   - The correct number of categories
   - The correct number of tests
   - The most recently added tests with their correct details

## Troubleshooting

If the dashboard still doesn't load data correctly after deployment:

1. Check the browser console for any API errors
2. Verify that the database connection is working properly
3. Ensure that the Railway environment variables are set correctly
4. Check that the API endpoints are accessible and returning the expected data
